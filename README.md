# Edulytics: Online COurse System

An online course system will be created to facilitate the e-learning process. A Student will be asked to register himself on the course portal. Information about the student like his name, date of birth, phone number, email id, highest educational degree will be entered by the student into the portal. So that student will be able to login on the portal. Then, the student will be shown his dashboard where all his completed and enrolled courses will be displayed. He will also have access to the progress of his fellow peers doing the same course. Like every student, every instructor will also have a profile and a dashboard. He will be provided login details and his profile will represent the courses he has taught and the feedback received for those courses. The qualifications of the instructor will also be shown. Instructors are assigned to the course on the basis of his expertise.

On the homepage, the courses offered will be categorised according to their Name, Duration, Rating, Start Date. There will also be tags for further sub-categorisation. For eg. A course to master Web Development in Ruby will have tags saying Ruby, Web, Development. The student will click on the course to enroll and then will be asked to pay a predetermined fees for the course using a payment gateway, if it is not a free course available for auditing.

On enrolling successfully, the student will be directed to the course materials section.
Every course will have videos which will be viewed by the student. Every video is taken by an instructor. Every video will have a specified length(duration), description, with a problem set and will be of specific topic.

Post every video, certain questions, framed by the instructors, will be present which the students will be required to answer to proceed to the content ahead. This will ensure reinforcement of the learning done through the video. Each question will have be a multiple choice question and will have 4 options. 
Progress of studentâ€™s course will be determined by the number of problems attempted by the student and its score will be calculated based on the correct answers given by him by comparing the correct option to the option marked by him.

Post the completion of the course, the student will be asked to fill up a detailed feedback form.

The feedback form will ask the student to rate the course on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest. The form will also ask the student to rate the instructors. Parameters to rate the instructor will be : Simplicity in describing technical terms, practical work involved. The feedback will include a description and will also show the date on which it has been filled. This feedback will be very important and will reflect in the rating of the course and the profile of the instructor.
